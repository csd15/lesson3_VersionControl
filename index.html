            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this assignment we were asked to choose five topics that we found interesting from Lesson 3. The first topic that I deemed important was version control and version control systems. Version control is one main repository for all of the project files. To further explain. Version control is a system that record changes to a file or a set of files overtime so that they can be recalled later. A version control system (VCS) gives a revision history and merges changes to the same file. The use of a VCS enables easy recovery if mistakes are made. GitHub is an example of a Version Control System that popular with notorious companies like Facebook. We’re using GitHub in this course because of how ubiquitous it is.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The second important topic covered in this lesson is the advantages of using a version control system for developers. One of our peers explained that the company he works for uses a version control system because of its accessibility and recovery benefits. There are many advantages to using as VCS. It solves the file sharing problem and allows people to work simultaneously. Files cannot be overwritten and all files are backed up. Version control systems also allow the user to revert back to an older version. This topic is interesting to me because a plethora of major mass media use VCS, specifically GitHub. It could be a possibility that my future job will use a VCS.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Lesson 3 also introduced the Basic Git commands. The eight commands including the three remote commands are as follows: git init, git add—all, git commit, git log, git status, git remove, git pull, and git push. The git init command creates the initial “.git” directory in a new or previous existing project according to site ground.com. Git add just add’s files into your directory while git commit sets a branch to point to the updated file. Git status shows the status of your files and git log shows all the commits made before hand. The three remote commands: git remote shows all your remote repository versions while git push and git pull deal with the storing and retrieving of files. These basic commands are essential to this course because they operate together in a way that makes GitHub and other VCS’ successful</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In Lesson 2.1 on git-scm.com, two methods are introduced to getting a Git Repository. One approach takes an existing project and imports it into Git, the other “clones” an existing Git Repository from another server (similar to local versus remote repositories). To create a repository by importing, you must create a subdirectory named .git then begin tracking files with an initial commit. This is the git add and git commit commands. On the other hand, to clone an existing repository you must use the git clone command followed by a left angle bracket, the URL and a right angle bracket. This creates a directory for the file located in your URL. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was introduced in 2005 from an older DVCS called BitKeeper. Linux Kernel, an open software project, created the software in 2002. Due to unfortunate and ongoing issues between the Linux Kernel community and the company that developed BitKeeper, the tool’s public and free use was revoked. The created of Linux prompted that they move forward and create a new system with Speed, Simple Design, parallel branches, is fully distributed and can handle very large scale projects. What makes GitHub better than other Version Control systems is its “snapshot” behavior. Imagine that each time a document, program, etc. is modified; GitHub is taking snapshots as a way to retain memory. All of this information and more can be accessed on git-scm.com</p>
